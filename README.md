# MLB_Playoff_Classifying

The goal of the project was to practice web scraping skills and classification techniques to a real-world data set. The web data was scraped from baseball-reference.com and followed their robots.txt terms. 

Once scraped, the data was manipulated and cleaned in Python, with the modeling done leveraging Python's sklearn package. Overall, the best performing model was able to predict 9 out of the 10 teams that made the playoffs this year after being trained and tested on data from 1969-2017.
